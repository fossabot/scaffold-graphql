# ScaffoldJS

I am creating a compilation of tools that runs with **GraphQL** and **Typescript**, but if it doesn't work well with graphql and typescript I will be deleting it on the list. Most of the templates will use **TypeORM** but will look on other tools such as **Seqeulize**, **Waterline**, etc.
